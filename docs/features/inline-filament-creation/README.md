# Inline Filament Creation Feature

## Overview

This feature allows users to create new filament types directly from the "Add Product" page without navigating away from their current workflow. Users can define filament types for cost calculations, with the option to add them to inventory tracking.

## Problem Statement

Currently, when adding a product, if the required filament type is not in the list, users must:
1. Stop their product creation workflow
2. Navigate to the Filaments tab
3. Add a filament purchase (which creates the filament)
4. Navigate back to Products
5. Start over or continue with product creation

This interrupts the workflow and can lead to abandoned product creations. Additionally, users may want to:
- Use filament types they plan to purchase later
- Use filaments they have but don't track in inventory
- Define products before having all materials on hand

## Solution

Enable inline filament type creation through a modal dialog with:
1. **Filament Type Definition**: Color, brand, material, and estimated cost
2. **Optional Inventory Tracking**: Checkbox to add initial purchase/inventory
3. **Inventory Warnings**: Visual alerts when using filaments with no tracked inventory

This separates the concepts of:
- **Filament Types**: Product definitions used for COGS calculation
- **Filament Inventory**: Actual stock tracking with purchases

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Seamless workflow without context switching
2. **Data Integrity**: Atomic creation of filament with initial purchase
3. **Consistency**: Reuses existing validation and business logic
4. **Flexibility**: Component can be reused in other contexts

## Technical Requirements

- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Context (existing DataProvider)
- UI Components: Existing UI component library

## Success Criteria

1. Users can create new filaments without leaving the product creation page
2. New filaments appear immediately in the selection dropdown
3. All filament creation follows existing business rules
4. No data inconsistencies between filaments and purchases
5. Clear error messages for validation failures
6. Smooth user experience with loading states and feedback

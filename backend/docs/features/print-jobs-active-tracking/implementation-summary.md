# Print Jobs Active Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the print job active tracking feature that allows users to start print jobs, track their progress with real-time countdown timers, and prevents printer conflicts.

## Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `started_at` timestamp field to track when jobs begin printing
- Added `estimated_completion_at` timestamp field for completion estimates
- Created indexes for efficient status queries
- Implemented migrations for both PostgreSQL and SQLite

### 2. Backend API
- Created `PUT /print_jobs/{id}/start` endpoint
- Implemented printer conflict prevention logic
- Added automatic calculation of estimated completion time
- Updated job status transitions: pending → printing → completed

### 3. Frontend UI Enhancements
- Renamed "Print Queue" tab to "Print Jobs"
- Split UI into two sections:
  - **Currently Printing**: Shows active jobs with progress bars
  - **Job Queue**: Shows pending jobs ready to start
- Added Start button for each pending job
- Implemented real-time countdown timers
- Added dynamic progress bars showing completion percentage

### 4. Key Features
- **Printer Conflict Prevention**: Prevents starting a job if printer is already in use
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress bars and countdown timers update every second
- **Job Details**: Shows product quantities and assigned printers
- **Visual Feedback**: Green theme for active jobs, clear status indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Progress Calculation
```typescript
const calculateProgress = (job) => {
  const startTime = new Date(job.started_at).getTime()
  const endTime = new Date(job.estimated_completion_at).getTime()
  const now = currentTime.getTime()
  
  const totalDuration = endTime - startTime
  const elapsed = now - startTime
  
  return Math.round((elapsed / totalDuration) * 100)
}
```

### Conflict Prevention
```python
active_jobs = db.query(PrintJob).join(PrintJobPrinter).filter(
    PrintJob.status == "printing",
    PrintJobPrinter.printer_profile_id == printer_id
).first()

if active_jobs:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=409, detail="Printer in use")
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests covering:
- Successful job start scenarios
- Printer conflict detection
- Multiple printer simultaneous operation
- Job status transitions

## Future Enhancements
- WebSocket support for real-time updates without page refresh
- Pause/resume functionality
- Print failure handling and recovery
- Historical accuracy tracking
- Batch job management
